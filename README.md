# checktree

This component is a simple Angular implementation of Tree for heirarchical/categorical selection similar to [Angular Material Tree](https://material.angular.io/components/tree/examples#tree-checklist) with checkboxes. Please refer to this [implementation](https://github.com/fanatic007/checktree.git) as an example for usage, models or implementation.

## Development server

Run `ng serve --open --project=checktreeimpl` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically run with hardcoded dummy data based on this [api](https://www.mocky.io/v2/5cff79fc3200007100eac68f) (not owned by me).

## Build

Run `ng build checktree --configuration=production` to build lib (component) project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
